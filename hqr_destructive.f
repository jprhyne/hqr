c
c     this subroutine is a translation of the algol procedure hqr,
c     num. math. 14, 219-231(1970) by martin, peters, and wilkinson.
c     handbook for auto. comp., vol.ii-linear algebra, 359-371(1971).
c
c     this subroutine finds the eigenvalues of a real
c     upper hessenberg matrix by the qr method.
c
c     on input
c
c        nm must be set to the row dimension of two-dimensional
c          array parameters as declared in the calling program
c          dimension statement.
c
c        n is the order of the matrix.
c
c        low and igh are integers determined by the balancing
c          subroutine  balanc.  if  balanc  has not been used,
c          set low=1, igh=n.
c
c        h contains the upper hessenberg matrix.  information about
c          the transformations used in the reduction to hessenberg
c          form by  elmhes  or  orthes, if performed, is stored
c          in the remaining triangle under the hessenberg matrix.
c
c     on output
c
c        h has been destroyed.  therefore, it must be saved
c          before calling  hqr  if subsequent calculation and
c          back transformation of eigenvectors is to be performed.
c
c        wr and wi contain the real and imaginary parts,
c          respectively, of the eigenvalues.  the eigenvalues
c          are unordered except that complex conjugate pairs
c          of values appear consecutively with the eigenvalue
c          having the positive imaginary part first.  if an
c          error exit is made, the eigenvalues should be correct
c          for indices ierr+1,...,n.
c
c        ierr is set to
c          zero       for normal return,
c          j          if the limit of 30*n iterations is exhausted
c                     while the j-th eigenvalue is being sought.
