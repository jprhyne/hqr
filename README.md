# hqr
This repository works on transcribing hqr.f and hqr2.f from eispack into C to convert a Hessenberg matrix into the quasi-Schur form using orthogonal similarity transformation.

# TODO
Simple rewrite of indices using macros does not fix issues. Next step is to write out an outline of hqr.f to better understand the flow control
